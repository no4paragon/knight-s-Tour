This is the knight's tour.

For this project, take the code from your last project.

Separate the knights class from your source file. Put the class in a header file and a class content file.

The program will do the following:

-Ask the user for a starting position.
-Places the knight in that starting position and calculates all legal moves. Each move will be numbered.
-The user will choose a number and the knight will move to that space and recalculate the number of legal moves.
-With each move you will also give the user the option to either start a new game or exit the program.
-The program ends when the user wishes.
