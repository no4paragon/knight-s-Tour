<div class="description user_content enhanced"><p>This is the knight's tour.</p>
<p>For this project, take the code from your last project.</p>
<p>Separate the knights class from your source file. Put the class in a header file and a class content file.</p>
<p>The program will do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask the user for a starting position.</li>
<li>Places the knight in that starting position and calculates all legal moves. Each move will be numbered.</li>
<li>The user will choose a number and the knight will move to that space and recalculate the number of legal moves.</li>
<li>With each move you will also give the user the option to either start a new game or exit the program.</li>
<li>The program ends when the user wishes.</li>
</ul></div>
